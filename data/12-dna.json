  "narrative": "Twenty years later, GFS's DNA lives on—mutated, evolved, but recognizable. HDFS cloned it wholesale. S3 took its lessons and built something new. Colossus kept the good parts, fixed the rest. Some ideas were timeless: control/data separation, commodity hardware, failure as normal state. Some ideas were contextual: single master, 64MB chunks, weak consistency everywhere. The measure of great systems design isn't immortality—it's influence. GFS died. Its children rule the world.",
