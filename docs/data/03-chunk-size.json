  "narrative": "One number to rule them all: 64MB. Not 1MB, not 1GB, but 64MB. This single decision echoes through every corner of GFS. Too small, and the Master drowns in metadata. Too large, and small files become islands in an ocean of wasted space. They found the sweet spot through rigorous quantitative analysis: balancing metadata overhead, network efficiency, and storage utilization.",
