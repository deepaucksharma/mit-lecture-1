Colossus kept the good parts, fixed the rest. Some ideas were timeless: control/data separation, commodity hardware, failure as normal state. Some ideas were contextual: single master, 64MB chunks, weak consistency everywhere. The measure of great systems design isn't immortality—it's influence. GFS died. Its children rule the world.",
