  - Added `.correct-answer` styling

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing Framework** ✅

#### **Main Test Suite (`test-suite.js`)** - 37KB
A comprehensive E2E test suite that:
- Launches real browser (Puppeteer)
- Navigates through all 13 specifications
- Tests 9 different aspects per spec:
  1. Diagram rendering
  2. Crystallized insights
  3. Prerequisites
  4. First Principles tab
  5. Advanced Concepts
  6. Assessment Checkpoints
  7. Drills with ThoughtProcess
  8. Scene Navigation
  9. Interactive Elements

**Key Features:**
- Takes screenshots at every step
- Simulates real user interactions (clicking, typing, navigating)
- Generates HTML, Markdown, and JSON reports
- Tracks console errors and JavaScript errors
- Measures content length and element counts

#### **Test Runner Script (`run-tests.sh`)** - 9.5KB
Orchestrates all testing:
- Manages server lifecycle
- Runs multiple test suites
- Generates combined reports
- Creates screenshot galleries
- Provides color-coded console output

#### **Package.json Updates**
Added new test commands:
```json
"test": "./run-tests.sh"
"test:comprehensive": "node test-suite.js"
"test:enhanced": "node tests/test-enhanced-features.js"
"test:report": "open tests/reports/test-report.html"
```

## 📸 Screenshot Coverage

Each test run captures:
- **Per Specification (13 specs × ~8 screenshots = 104+ screenshots)**
  - Main diagram view
  - Crystallized insight panel
  - First Principles tab
  - Advanced Concepts section
  - Assessment Checkpoints
  - Drills with expanded answers
  - Drill interaction results
  - Multiple scene states

- ✅ insight messages with special styling
- ✅ Prerequisites panel visibility
- ✅ Assessment checkpoints display
- ✅ Scene/state management
- ✅ Interactive element responsiveness

## 📊 Test Reports Generated

### 1. **HTML Report** (`test-report.html`)
- Visual dashboard with pass/fail statistics
- Color-coded test results
- Screenshot references
- Error tracking
- Progress bars

### 2. **Markdown Report** (`test-report.md`)
- Detailed test results per spec
- Pass/fail icons
- Content metrics
- Error descriptions

### 3. **JSON Report** (`test-results.json`)
- Machine-readable results
- Complete test details
- Error stack traces
- Timing information

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:comprehensive

# View test report
npm run test:report

# Start test server
npm run start:test
```

### What Happens During Testing:
1. Server starts on port 8888
2. Browser launches (can be headless or visible)
3. App loads and initializes
4. Tests navigate through each spec
5. Screenshots captured at each step
6. User interactions simulated
7. Content verified
8. Reports generated
9. Server cleaned up

## 📈 Test Coverage Statistics

- **Total Test Points:** ~117 (9 tests × 13 specs)
- **Screenshot Coverage:** 100+ images per full run
- **Interaction Types:** 10+ different user actions
- **Content Checks:** 20+ different verification types
- **Report Formats:** 3 (HTML, Markdown, JSON)

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **End-User Perspective:** Tests interact with the app exactly as a user would
